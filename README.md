## About

I’m Ritesh Patel, a dynamic professional with 21 years of rich and diverse experience, including 8 years in project and program management. My journey blends creativity and technical acumen, starting with my roots as an artist and evolving into a creator of impactful digital products that address business challenges and improve user experiences. From crafting stories as a 2D animation developer to shaping digital landscapes as a web developer, my career has been a constant evolution. My time in startups honed my skills in agile methodologies and end-to-end product management, allowing me to drive ideas from inception to execution. At Investis, I spearheaded critical projects, including managing three company acquisitions with meticulous feature mapping, seamless migrations, and integrations into a core Investor Relations product suite.

Currently, as a Program Manager at Publicis Sapient, I lead transformative digital initiatives in Automotive, Energy, and Commodities. I’ve achieved measurable results, such as reducing user onboarding time from 9 days to just 4 hours and cutting manual inquiries by 50%. My work with Nissan introduced an eCommerce solution across Australia, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi. Recognized for my leadership and innovation, I recently received the prestigious PCG All Stars Award in the Program Manager category.
Beyond my professional achievements, I hold certifications such as Scrum Alliance CSM, CSPO, SAFe Agilist, SAFe POPM, and AWS Cloud Practitioner. Additionally, I’ve leveraged Gen AI to optimize sprint capacity planning, enabling efficient resource utilization across POD teams—especially with shared resources. With a unique blend of creativity, strategic insight, and technical expertise, I am passionate about aligning innovation with execution and empowering teams to deliver outstanding results.
